# Day-5---7D7S-Pokemon-API
Building and learning this Pokemon API. I love that I have discovered something that relates to my childhood and coding. 
I am not done but I am logging this for #7D7S and I will build on it as I learn. 

First time doing APIs and I am learning alot. I am 5 days into 7D7S and I have learned alot about myself and time it takes to code.

Coding can be an all day project. Effective planning leads to awesome sites and designs.

I will need to continue to work on my time management and focus on being ahead. This weekend, I am going to work on all my site from this week
and get them optimized.

Doing good so keep it up!
